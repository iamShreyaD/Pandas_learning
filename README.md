# Pandas_learning

This repository documents my hands-on practice with the Pandas library using a [publicly available tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXtjG_GzO7Q&t=2004s).

It includes:
• Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sample CSV dataset
• Data manipulation using functions such as groupby, indexing, and aggregation
• Data cleaning and preprocessing (dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing data, fixing inconsistent values, standardizing text, fixing data types, removing duplicates)
• Well-structured Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) demonstrating step-by-step transformations

The attached Data.csv file is the source dataset used in the notebook.
